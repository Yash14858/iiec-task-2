# iiec-task-2
The 2nd task given by IIEC-RISE to create a menu which can run Docker commands to launched and stop any Operating System.

# About the task
In this task we can give voice commands to launched or stop Operating System in Docker and it will open a Web Apllication accordingly.  

# What is Docker ?
   Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and deploy it as one package. It is a Container technology used to launched different Operating Systems in few seconds. It provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. The isolation and security allow you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. We can even run Docker containers within host machines that are actually virtual machines,
    for example :- In RHEL 8 Operating System we can open other operating systems like ubuntu:14.04 and centos:7 by using docker.

# How it works?

=> First of all we have to run the python menu on IDLE, it will ask you for your voice command.

![]

=> If you give a command to start or open docker it will take you to the Web Application where you can launched any operating system whoes image files availabel in select option.

=> And if you give a command to stop or quit docker it will take you to the Web Application where you can stop the running operating system in your  RHEL 8 system.
